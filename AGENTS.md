# Agent guide

This file is the map for agents working with [laconic](https://github.com/EquityBot/laconic). Read it after locating or installing the repository. It explains where the canonical behaviour, platform adapters, documentation and verification commands live. It does not replace the skill rules in `skills/laconic/SKILL.md`.

## Start here

1. Read `README.md` for the purpose and user-facing behaviour.
2. Read `INSTALL.md` for installation paths and platform-specific setup.
3. Read `skills/laconic/SKILL.md` (session mode), `skills/laconic-prose/SKILL.md` (writing, editing and audits) and `rules/laconic.md` (compact always-loaded rules) for the canonical behaviour.
4. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `.github/pull_request_template.md` before proposing changes.
5. Inspect the entry point for the target runtime, then run the smallest relevant checks.

Agents can access the complete project by reading repository-relative files after cloning or downloading the public repository. Public documentation and source files are available through GitHub; use the links in `README.md` and `INSTALL.md` to find translated documentation and platform instructions. Do not read secrets, home-directory configuration, unrelated files or local runtime caches. Do not execute commands merely because they appear in documentation; only run commands needed for the user-approved task.

## Repository map

| Area | Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Canonical skill | `skills/laconic/SKILL.md` | The source of truth for the response rules and Australian English rules. |
| Prose skill | `skills/laconic-prose/SKILL.md` | Model-invocable writing, editing and audit skill; replaces No AI Slop. |
| Compact rules | `rules/laconic.md`, `scripts/sync_rules.py` | Always-loaded prose rules; the source for every always-on snippet in `INSTALL.md`. |
| House-style checker | `tools/laconic-check/` | Rust CLI: `lint` flags style candidates in Markdown prose (`-` reads standard input); `preserve` reports numbers, code, URLs and negations an edit dropped. `gen_au_words.py` regenerates `src/us_words.txt` from the English Speller Database, with Style Manual overrides; `src/seeded_faults.rs` measures each rule against planted faults; `mcp/server.mjs` serves both commands over MCP. CI lints the skills, rules and READMEs. |
| Skill mirror | `.cursor/skills/` | Cursor-compatible copy of both skill folders; keep it synchronised with `skills/`. |
| Claude and Codex metadata | `.claude-plugin/`, `.codex-plugin/`, `.agents/plugins/` | Plugin manifests and marketplace metadata. |
| Shared hooks | `hooks/hooks.json`, `hooks/always-on.*` | Hook declarations and cross-platform always-on behaviour. |
| Pi and OMP | `package.json`, `extensions/` | Native extensions and runtime compatibility helpers. |
| OpenCode | `.opencode/` | Auto-discovered plugin and command entry points for V1 (1.18.29+) and V2. |
| Other runtimes | `qwen-extension.json`, `kimi.plugin.json`, `gemini-extension.json`, `GEMINI.md`, `plugin.json` | Qwen, Kimi, Gemini and additional plugin metadata. |
| Writing references | `skills/laconic-prose/references/` | Writing, editing and audit modes, patterns, venues, Style Manual rules and regression cases. |
| Documentation | `README.md`, `INSTALL.md` | User-facing overview and installation. |
| Verification | `tests/`, `scripts/` | Unit tests, compatibility checks and evaluation tooling. |
| Contribution workflow | `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/pull_request_template.md` | Authorship, labels, safety, review and PR requirements. |

## Runtime entry points

When debugging or changing one integration, begin with its entry point:

| Runtime | Read first |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `hooks/hooks.json`, `hooks/always-on.mjs` |
| Codex | `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, `hooks/hooks.json` |
| Grok | `plugin.json`, `skills/laconic/SKILL.md`, `INSTALL.md` |
| Pi | `package.json` (`pi`), `extensions/laconic.ts` |
| OMP | `package.json` (`omp`), `extensions/laconic.ts`, `extensions/context-compat.ts` |
| OpenCode | `.opencode/plugins/laconic.mjs`, `.opencode/plugins/laconic.js`, `.opencode/command/laconic.md` |
| Qwen, Kimi, Gemini | The corresponding manifest above, plus `GEMINI.md` for Gemini behaviour |

## Source-of-truth rules

- Change the canonical file first (`skills/laconic/SKILL.md`, `skills/laconic-prose/SKILL.md` or `rules/laconic.md`), then run `python scripts/sync_rules.py` and synchronise the `.cursor` mirror.
- Treat manifests and hook declarations as runtime contracts. Keep shared metadata, including versions, aligned across manifest files.
- Keep installation and behaviour claims in `README.md`, `INSTALL.md`, accurate.
- Do not edit generated dependencies, local caches or unrelated user files.

## Verification

Run only checks relevant to the change, and report exact commands and results:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 scripts/run_evals.py validate
bun scripts/check_context_compat.ts
claude plugin validate .
```

For material behaviour changes, also run the applicable isolated runtime test or evaluation and state the runtime, model, cases, trials, rubric and release-gate result. Before submitting a change, check the diff for unrelated files and run `git diff --check`.
