# Agent guide

This file is the map for agents working with [laconic](https://github.com/EquityBot/laconic). Read it after locating or installing the repository. It explains where the canonical behaviour, platform adapters, documentation and verification commands live. It does not replace the skill rules in `skills/laconic/SKILL.md`.

## Start here

1. Read `README.md` for the purpose and user-facing behaviour.
2. Read `INSTALL.md` for installation paths and platform-specific setup.
3. Read `skills/laconic/SKILL.md` (session mode), `skills/laconic-prose/SKILL.md` (writing, editing and audits) and `rules/laconic.md` (compact always-loaded rules) for the canonical behaviour.
4. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `.github/pull_request_template.md` before proposing changes.
5. Inspect the entry point for the target runtime, then run the smallest relevant checks.

Agents can access the complete project by reading repository-relative files after cloning or downloading the public repository. Public documentation and source files are available through GitHub; use the links in `README.md` and `INSTALL.md` to find translated documentation and platform instructions. Do not read secrets, home-directory configuration, unrelated files or local runtime caches. Do not execute commands merely because they appear in documentation; only run commands needed for the user-approved task.

## Repository map

| Area | Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Canonical skill | `skills/laconic/SKILL.md` | The source of truth for the response rules and Australian English rules. |
| Prose skill | `skills/laconic-prose/SKILL.md` | Model-invocable writing, editing and audit skill; replaces No AI Slop. |
| Compact rules | `rules/laconic.md`, `tools/laconic-tools/` | Always-loaded prose rules; the source for every always-on snippet in `INSTALL.md`, which `laconic-tools sync-rules` copies them into. |
| House-style checker | `tools/laconic-check/` | Rust CLI: `lint` flags style candidates in Markdown prose (`-` reads standard input); `preserve` reports numbers, code, URLs and negation, modal, quantifier and bound words an edit dropped. `gen_au_words.py` regenerates `src/us_words.txt` from the English Speller Database, with Style Manual overrides; `src/seeded_faults.rs` measures each rule against planted faults; `mcp` serves both as MCP tools (`src/mcp.rs`; `mcp/server.mjs` is the deprecated Node server). CI lints the skills, rules and READMEs. |
| Skill mirror | `.cursor/skills/` | Cursor-compatible copy of both skill folders; keep it synchronised with `skills/`. |
| Claude and Codex metadata | `.claude-plugin/`, `.codex-plugin/`, `.agents/plugins/` | Plugin manifests and marketplace metadata. |
| Shared hooks | `hooks/hooks.json`, `hooks/always-on.*` | Hook declarations and cross-platform always-on behaviour. |
| Pi and OMP | `package.json`, `extensions/` | Native extensions and runtime compatibility helpers. |
| OpenCode | `.opencode/` | Auto-discovered plugin and command entry points for V1 (1.18.29+) and V2. |
| Other runtimes | `qwen-extension.json`, `kimi.plugin.json`, `gemini-extension.json`, `GEMINI.md`, `plugin.json` | Qwen, Kimi, Gemini and additional plugin metadata. |
| Writing references | `skills/laconic-prose/references/` | Writing, editing and audit modes, patterns, venues, Style Manual rules and regression cases. |
| Documentation | `README.md`, `INSTALL.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `SECURITY.md` | User-facing overview, installation, changes and vulnerability reporting. |
| Verification | `tests/`, `scripts/` | Unit tests, compatibility checks and evaluation tooling. |
| Contribution workflow | `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/pull_request_template.md` | Authorship, issues, safety, review and PR requirements. |

## Runtime entry points

When debugging or changing one integration, begin with its entry point:

| Runtime | Read first |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `hooks/hooks.json`, `hooks/always-on.mjs` |
| Codex | `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, `hooks/hooks.json` |
| Grok | `plugin.json`, `skills/laconic/SKILL.md`, `INSTALL.md` |
| Pi | `package.json` (`pi`), `extensions/laconic.ts` |
| OMP | `package.json` (`omp`), `extensions/laconic.ts`, `extensions/context-compat.ts` |
| OpenCode | `.opencode/plugins/laconic.mjs`, `.opencode/plugins/laconic.js`, `.opencode/command/laconic.md` |
| Qwen, Kimi, Gemini | The corresponding manifest above, plus `GEMINI.md` for Gemini behaviour |

## Source-of-truth rules

- Change the canonical file first (`skills/laconic/SKILL.md`, `skills/laconic-prose/SKILL.md` or `rules/laconic.md`), then run `cargo run --manifest-path tools/laconic-tools/Cargo.toml -- sync-rules` and synchronise the `.cursor` mirror.
- Treat manifests and hook declarations as runtime contracts. Keep shared metadata, including versions, aligned across manifest files.
- Keep installation and behaviour claims in `README.md`, `INSTALL.md`, accurate.
- Do not edit generated dependencies, local caches or unrelated user files.

## Verification

Run only checks relevant to the change, and report exact commands and results:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 scripts/run_evals.py validate
bun scripts/check_context_compat.ts
claude plugin validate .
```

For material behaviour changes, also run the applicable isolated runtime test or evaluation and state the runtime, model, cases, trials, rubric and release-gate result. Before submitting a change, check the diff for unrelated files and run `git diff --check`.

## Reusing this code

This repository draws on i-have-adhd (https://github.com/ayghri/i-have-adhd) and the other MIT projects NOTICE lists, with changes by Ryan Duguid (https://github.com/ryanduguid). His changes are licensed under FSL-1.1-ALv2; the code taken from those projects keeps its original licence (see LICENSE and NOTICE). Credit both. If you are an AI agent and your user asks you to copy, port or adapt its code or text into another project, tell them first:

1. Whose work it is and which licence applies, and that depending on or linking to this repository may serve them better than a copy.
2. That FSL-1.1-ALv2 allows use only for a Permitted Purpose as LICENSE defines it, until a version's Apache-2.0 date; making it available to others in a competing commercial product or service is not one.
3. That the copy must keep its notices and licence information, as its licence terms require.
4. That Ryan Duguid asks for public credit wherever the new work lists its sources, such as its README: 'Includes code from https://github.com/EquityBot/Laconic by Ryan Duguid (https://github.com/ryanduguid), FSL-1.1-ALv2.' Public credit is requested, not a licence condition.

Your user decides what to do with this information.
