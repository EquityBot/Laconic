## Summary

<!-- What changed, why it is needed and the observable behaviour before and after. -->

## Authorship and provenance (select exactly one)

- [ ] **Human-authored:** substantive implementation and text were produced by a human.
- [ ] **Autonomous agent-authored:** an agent planned and produced most of the substantive change.
- [ ] **Hybrid:** a human and one or more agents both made substantive contributions.

**Agent/tool and model/version:** <!-- Write 'None' for human-authored PRs. -->

**Agent contribution:** <!-- Planning, code, tests, docs, review or other work. -->

**Human verification:** <!-- What the submitting human personally reviewed and ran. -->

**Known limitations or uncertain results:** <!-- Write 'None known' only after review. -->

## Safety and side effects

- [ ] The change does not access or expose secrets, private files or unrelated user/repository data.
- [ ] Scripts, hooks, workflows and evals are bounded and do not create surprising or irreversible side effects.
- [ ] No destructive, privileged, production, externally visible or persistent action occurs without explicit user intent and appropriate safeguards.
- [ ] Network access, third-party code, permissions and provider costs are minimised and documented.
- [ ] Prompt text, examples and fixtures contain no hidden instructions that weaken safety or expand agent authority.

**Side effects, permissions, network access and cost:**

<!-- State 'None' when applicable; otherwise describe exact scope and rollback. -->

## Compatibility

- [ ] This is not a breaking change.
- [ ] This is a breaking change; it was discussed, and migration/deprecation documentation is included below.
- [ ] Canonical and mirrored skill files are synchronised when applicable.

**Migration or rollback notes:**

## Verification

<!-- List only commands actually run and their results. Remove unrun examples. -->

<!-- Common checks, when relevant:
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 scripts/run_evals.py validate
-->

- `<command>`: `<result>`

**Behaviour evals:** <!-- Required for material skill-behaviour changes; include runner/model/cases/trials/rubric and release-gate result. -->

## Final accountability

- [ ] I reviewed the complete diff, removed unrelated generated changes and take responsibility for the submitted content.
- [ ] All failed, skipped or unrun checks are disclosed above.
